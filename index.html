            Long-exposure, time-exposure, or slow-shutter photography involves
            using a long-duration shutter speed to sharply capture the stationary
            elements of images while blurring, smearing, or obscuring the moving
            elements. Long-exposure photography captures one element that
            conventional photography does not: an extended period of time. The
            paths of bright moving objects become clearly visibleâ€”clouds form
            broad bands, vehicle lights draw bright streaks, stars leave trails in
            the sky, and water waves appear smooth. Only bright objects leave
            visible trails, whereas dark objects usually disappear. Boats in long
            exposures disappear during the daytime, but draw bright trails from
            their lights at night.

            A double e xposure is a combination of two images into one where one
            image is overlaid onto another at less than full opacity. This is done
            with artistic intent (unless you're shooting film and forgot to wind
            it between shots, but still you might get a serendipitously happy
            accident.) This can be done in-camera or in post processing. In film
            photography, double exposures are made by exposing the same portion of
            film twice, resulting in an the second image being superimposed on the
            first. In digital photography, double exposures can be made in-camera
            in some cases when it's available as a creative effect in a body, in
            photoshop, or in apps designed specifically to make digital double
            exposures.
